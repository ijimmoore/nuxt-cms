# nuxt-cms
This is phase 1 of a project to build a Nuxtjs and CMS demo

All code for this Nuxt project was either cloned from 
https://github.com/nuxt-company/demo-blog-nuxt-content 
.... or entered following this tutorial: 
https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content
imo, the tutorial has some hiccups, but you may get by looking at the clone and the Nuxt and Tailwind docs

## Blog Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
